# Baseball-Betting
Takes Steamer projections (downloaded as CSV's from FanGraphs) and converts them into projected betting lines based off the teams playing and each team's starting lineup.

# Django Web App

Using Django, the Baseball Betting web application accepts the starting lineups and pitchers of a home and away team as inputs and returns projected winning percentages, projected american odds, and an offensive and defensive rating, expressed as runs per 162 games. Additionally, using current team ratings, the season simulator will simulate x number of seasons and return the average results!
